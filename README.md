# Sbox Classic Tycoon Game Terrain
A terrain system for the game S&Box by Facepunch that is in the style of a classic RTS, think Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon.

## Features:

- Biomes that decide terrain cell colouring (with per cell variation)
- Height procedural generation with falloff map towards the edge
- Biome procedural generation with temperature and rainfall deciding biome. 
- Terrain cell merging to avoid hard lines at biome boundaries
- Basic RTS style move/rotate camera
- Simple terrain chunking with chunks rendering based on camera distance
- Shader based terrain colouring, grid lines
- Shader based moving clouds on terrain
- Water
- World edge mesh generation
